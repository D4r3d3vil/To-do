## To try it out: 

## To install:
install code then,
```
cd To-do
npm create svelte@latest
npm i
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Requirements:
In order to work with Svelte, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed (It's recommended that you use the long-term support (LTS) version).<br />Node includes npm (the node package manager), and npx (the node package runner).<br />Note that you can also use the Yarn package manager in place of npm.<br />See Package management basics for more information on npm and yarn.
