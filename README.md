## To try it out: 

## To install:
install code then,
```
cd To-do
npm create svelte@latest
npm i
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Requirements:
In order to work with Svelte, you need to have Node.js installed._\__It's recommended that you use the long-term support (LTS) version.
Node includes npm (the node package manager), and npx (the node package runner). 
Note that you can also use the Yarn package manager in place of npm. 
See Package management basics for more information on npm and yarn.
